<h1>âœ… Car Price Data Cleaning Summary</h1>
    <p>This document summarizes all the data cleaning steps performed on the Car Price Prediction project dataset.</p>
    <h2> 1. Project Objective</h2>
    <p> The main goal was to prepare the data for Machine Learning (ML) modeling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by handling Missing Values, correcting incorrect formats, and addressing Inconsistent Data within the dataset.</p>
    <h2> 2. Columns Processed</h2>
    <p>Work was performed on **13 key columns**, and one column ($\text{G}$) was removed entirely.</p>

    <h2>3. Key Cleaning Actions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Numeric Imputation:</strong> Blank numeric cells were filled using the **Average** or **Median** value. All formulas were then converted to **Permanent Values**.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Price Cleanup:</strong> Non-numeric characters (like $\text{\$}$) were removed from $\text{sellingprice}$ and $\text{mmr}$ to ensure a clean $\text{Numeric}$ format.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Text Standardization:</strong> All text values were converted to **lowercase** using the $\text{LOWER}$ function for consistency. Excess spaces were removed, and blank text cells were filled with **"UNKNOWN"**.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Date Transformation:</strong> The $\text{saledate}$ column was separated, the $\text{PST}$ timezone was excluded, and the pieces were successfully reassembled and converted into a **standard Excel Date/Time format**.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Column Removal:</strong> The $\text{VIN}$ column ($\text{G}$) was **deleted** due to a high number of missing values.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Duplicate & Blank Rows:</strong> All **fully duplicate rows** and any **extra blank rows** at the bottom of the dataset were removed using Excel's dedicated functions.
        </li>
    </ul><h2>4. Final Status</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset is now clean, standardized, and **ready for analysis**.
